# HSLA Color Picker

This project is a simple and interactive color picker built using React, which allows users to adjust the hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha (transparency) values of a color using sliders. The color is represented in the HSLA format, and users can easily copy the generated HSLA value to their clipboard.

## Features

- **Dynamic Color Selection**: Users can modify the hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha values using sliders.
- **HSLA Value Display**: The current HSLA value is displayed in real-time as the sliders are adjusted.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: A button allows users to copy the HSLA value to their clipboard for use in other applications.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the components.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Logic and state management.
- **Navigator API**: Used for copying the HSLA value to the clipboard.
